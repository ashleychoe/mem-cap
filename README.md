**Features**
- Import photos or shoot with your device camera (including sequence mode — 4 shots in a row with countdown)
- Realistic print animation with scan-line reveal, film grain
- Customize the frame: background color, patterns, border style, caption, stickers
- Download the plain strip or the customized version
- Works entirely in the browser — no uploads, no account, no server
